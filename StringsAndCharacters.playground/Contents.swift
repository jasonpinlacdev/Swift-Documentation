// MARK: - Strings and Characters -

// A String is a value type
// A String is a series of the Character type
// The Character type is just an alias for a single character String literal
// Every String is composed of encoding independent unicode characters and provides ways for accessing the characters in various Unicode representions.

var str = "This is a String literal"
var char: Character = "c"

// MARK: - Multiline Strings -

// The ending """ determines how much space is prefixed on each line of the multiline string

var multiLineStr = """
    This is a
    multiline
    string
    .
    """

// You can see the example below there are 4 white spaces after each /n
var anotherMultiLineStr = """
    This is a
    multiline
    string
    .

// MARK: - Strings are Value Types -

// A new string value is copied when its passed to a function or method, or when its assigned to another variable/constant.
// Behind the scenes, Swiftâ€™s compiler optimizes string usage so that actual copying takes place only when absolutely necessary. This means you always get great performance when working with strings as value types.


// MARK: - You can access characters of a String using for-in loop -

for char in "Hello, World!" {
    print(char)
}

var anotherString = String(["J", "a", "s", "o", "n"])
